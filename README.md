# student management system
The Student Management System is a full-stack web application developed using Node.js, Express, and Vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to manage student records efficiently through a simple and responsive interface. The system supports adding, editing, deleting, and searching student details in real time. Data is stored in a local JSON file (students.json), making it lightweight and easy to deploy. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend uses Express.js to handle RESTful API requests. This project demonstrates a clear understanding of CRUD operations, API integration, and modular web application design.
